            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi. I'm Jawwad Uddin. I have recently graduated with a <span>1st class honours</span> in Mechanical Engineering at UCL and have decided to dive into software devlopement as a career path simply because I enjoy it!</p>
            <p>I am currently a <span>Futureproof Trainee Developer</span> and from what I have expereinced so far, it is evident that my background in problem solving, testament to studying Mechanical Engineering for 4 years, has fast tracked my ability to learn new technologies and develop skills at a fast pace.</p>
            <p>I have gone from knowing nothing about web development to being able to create <span>full stack applications</span> within the space of only 9 weeks.</p>
            <p>When I'm not working or developing a personal project, you'll find me playing football with my friends, regularly going to the gym, and spending time with family and friends. </p>
            <p>In the spirit of self-improvement, a few months ago I had decided to challenge myself to go out for a <span>5km jog every morning</span> for the rest of this year. Some mornings were dark, many were cold, some even rainy, and even with the regular feeling of soreness, I have successfully gone out every morning without fail and will continue to do so until the end of the year.</p>
